\section{Introduction}

Cracking control is a critical point in the design of concrete structures.
Uncontrolled cracking can have a major impact on the durability of reinforced
concrete structures, for several reasons including corrosion of metal rods.
For this reason, the risks of cracking during the early age of a structure have
been studied by numerous research teams in the past. In this chapter, the
results that have been found regarding the evaluation of cracking risks will be
observed.
